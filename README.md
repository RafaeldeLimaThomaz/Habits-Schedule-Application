## Habit Tracking <br>

The habit tracking screen is similar to the github activity log, the more habits completed, the brighter the log for that day. <br><br>

## Monitoring <br>

Checking and unchecking accomplishments changes the progress bar, but remember, you are not allowed to cheat by checking or unchecking on past days. <br>
