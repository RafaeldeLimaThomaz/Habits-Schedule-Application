## Habit Tracking 

The habit tracking screen is similar to the github activity log, the more habits completed, the brighter the log for that day.

## Monitoring 

Checking and unchecking accomplishments changes the progress bar, but remember, you are not allowed to cheat by checking or unchecking on past days.
